    <p>Option A, you kill me right here and now. Apparently I've made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too. A pointless exercise it seems to me but that is Option A.</p>
    <p>In one stroke, he bloodied both sides - set the American and Mexican governments against the Cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to himself. The rewards would be... enormous. </p>
    <p>He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep moving. You'll never find him. He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it. You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you have two.</p>
    <p>My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven year-old boy. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order. </p>
